# Tracky
Python/Flask Web Application designed to allow users to create "Counter" webpages and track the number of visits made to these pages.

Utilizes:
- Python and Flask to create a functioning backend for the website.
- Jinja2, HTML5, Javascript, and CSS to create basic web pages for data to be gathered and displayed.
- Python for UUID generation, allowing for unique web pages each time a Counter is created.
- JSON in order to store and access data (should this project get larger, I will implement a PostgreSQL Database in order to manage data).

Originally Created for Mrs. Brenda Moreno at Palatine High School in order to track the number of parents who found her weekly newsletters useful.
